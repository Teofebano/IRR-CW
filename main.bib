    abstract = {This paper examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 51 major stock markets, both emerging and developed. We isolated the countries susceptible to shock transmissions, and evaluated countries with immunity, during the lockdown. Specifically, using dependence dynamics and network analysis on a bivariate basis, we identify volatility and contagion risk among stock markets during the COVID-19 pandemic. The empirical findings add to the existing body of literature, given that previous work has not placed emphasis on network topologic metrics when it comes to financial networks, specifically during the COVID-19. The evidence shows instant financial contagion a result of the lockdown and the spread of the novel coronavirus. The methodological framework outlines important information for investors and policymakers on using financial networks to improve portfolio selection, by placing an emphasis on assets according to centrality.}

    abstract = {Banking sectors across the globe are under immense stress due to the evolving COVID-19 situation and policy responses thereto. This study investigates how COVID-19 impacted the systemic risk in the banking sectors of eight of the most COVID-19 affected countries. We find a significant increase in systemic risk among the sample countries initially, while stagnancy (at an elevated level) is observed during April 2020 except for China, which is showing some recovery. By using spillover measures, we also identify systemically important institutions. The findings of this study testify to the benefits of policy responses in containing systemic risk.}
